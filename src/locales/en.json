  "about_me_text": "My relationship with technology began in childhood, when I remember watching my father work on a computer, already yellowed by time, drawing in AutoCAD. That scene stuck in my memory and sparked my curiosity to understand how machines and programs worked. Years later, that curiosity turned into a career choice. Today, I am a Full-Stack Developer in training, with experience in Vue.js, React.js, Quasar Framework, Python, Django, and SQL. I have worked on projects ranging from the development of management systems to the creation of responsive and accessible interfaces, always applying good practices and exploring the potential of technology to turn ideas into real solutions. Currently, I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at UNIVALI, continue to specialize in modern technologies, and seek opportunities to learn, evolve, and contribute to innovative projects.",
